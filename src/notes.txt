- fixed up both the geo plotting, and the TOD plotting to be fairly general

- other ideas

  - happiness over time
  - happiness by TOD
  - happiness by locale?
  - radius of gyration (include some stats on the geo plot)
  - some sort of entropy? (train on first half)
  - add a bar chart to the right of the TOD plot

- hw05 of chaos this spring has some subplot action

- added the bar chart to right of TOD plot
- added a computation of happiness by hour, and plotted it.
  -some of the bins are too much too small
  -want to set some sort of sufficiency threshold, then
  	bin by that.

ideas:
- march along each tweet, until we get desired number of labMT word OR desired number of tweets.
for the instrument, i think that it should be number of LabMT words.
once we have enough, dump them into a bin, and find what that bin represents by figuring out when the first and last tweet were.
that would be happiness for  a bin of time that large.
however, the size of that bin may not represent accurately where all of those tweets came from.
we'd want to know the distribution of frequency within that bin.
could be visualized by making a box plot of the frequency within that bin.
or we could find the mean, and the std dev, and include those.
kind of like a box and whisker.

this kind of algorithm would work both within each hour, and across time.

vertical lines for mean and std dev.
