- fixed up both the geo plotting, and the TOD plotting to be fairly general

- other ideas

  - happiness over time
  - happiness by TOD
  - happiness by locale?
  - radius of gyration (include some stats on the geo plot)
  - some sort of entropy? (train on first half)
  - add a bar chart to the right of the TOD plot
