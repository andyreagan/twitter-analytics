going to follow the tutorial on authomatic on
http://peterhudec.github.io/authomatic/examples/simple.html
code for this is at
https://github.com/peterhudec/authomatic/tree/master/examples/gae/simple

could try the more advanced tutorial on his page

he has a live version running on google app engine at
http://authomatic-example.appspot.com
with code at
https://github.com/peterhudec/authomatic/tree/master/examples/gae/showcase

google's webapp2 documentation is at
https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/usingwebapp
i did this at some point, and had the hello world app going live

i then tried to get the django example on authomatic going, i think, but didn't get django to play nice with google's app engine
then it was all hopeless
i need to find out whether the zoo server supports wsgi for little python vacc app to work
the google app engine dashboard is at
https://appengine.google.com/dashboard?&app_id=s~computationalstorylabhedo
